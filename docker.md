# You create an image using a Dockerfile and a sample application.  

# Get Sample application
git clone https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker  

# Verify Your Dockerfile
Open the sample application in your IDE. Note that it already has a Dockerfile. For your own projects you need to create this yourself.  

# Build your first image
docker build -t welcome-to-docker   
.
# Breaking down this command
The -t flag tags your image with a name. (welcome-to-docker in this case). And the . lets Docker know where it can find the Dockerfile.  

# Run your Container
Once the build is complete, an image will appear in the Images tab. Select the image name to see its details. Select Run to run it as a container. In the Optional settings remember to specify a port number (something like 8089).  

# View Frontend
You now have a running container. If you don't have a name for your container, Docker provides one. View your container live by selecting the link below the container's name
